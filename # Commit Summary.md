## Merge fix-lfs branch to add Git LFS configuration (cb15db1)

Add Git LFS config for large file tracking.

This change configures Git Large File Storage (LFS) for tracking `pre-cleanup-backup.tar.gz`, adding it to both `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore`. This ensures the file is properly handled by LFS and not stored directly in the Git repository.

### Changes

- Added `pre-cleanup-backup.tar.gz` to Git LFS tracking in `.gitattributes`.
- Added `pre-cleanup-backup.tar.gz` to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being added to the repository directly.
- The filter, diff, and merge LFS attributes are enabled for `pre-cleanup-backup.tar.gz` in `.gitattributes`.

### Impact

- Git LFS will now be used to store and manage the `pre-cleanup-backup.tar.gz` file.
- This prevents the file from bloating the Git repository, improving repository size and performance.
- Developers need to have Git LFS installed to work with this repository correctly.
