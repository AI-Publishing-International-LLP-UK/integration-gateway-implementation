## Configure Git LFS for large files and update gitignore (3e06e94)

Configured Git LFS and updated .gitignore for large files.

This change configures Git Large File Storage (LFS) for specific file types and adds a large backup file to the .gitignore. This prevents large binary files from being tracked directly in the Git repository, improving repository size and performance.

### Changes

- Configured Git LFS to track *.pkg,*.dmg, **/node20/bin/node, pre-cleanup-backup.tar.gz, and *.tar.gz files. This was done by adding file type patterns to .gitattributes and associating them with the lfs filter, diff, and merge configurations.
- Added `pre-cleanup-backup.tar.gz` to the .gitignore file. This prevents this large backup file from being tracked by Git.
- Modified files: .gitattributes, .gitignore.

### Impact

- Prevents large binary files from being stored directly in the Git repository, reducing repository size.
- The behavioral change is that the specified files will now be tracked by Git LFS instead of Git directly.
- The `pre-cleanup-backup.tar.gz` file will no longer be tracked, preventing accidental commits of large backup files.
- There are no apparent breaking changes or performance implications beyond the improved repository efficiency.
