## ci: Add workflow for emotion tuning system deployment (1998558)

CI: Adds workflow for emotion tuning deployment.

This change introduces a new GitHub Actions workflow to automate the build and deployment of the emotion tuning system. The workflow is triggered on pushes to the `deploy-symphony-interface` branch when changes are made to specific files related to emotion tuning and speech services.

### Changes
- Added a new workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy-emotion-tuner.yml`.
- The workflow is triggered by pushes to the `deploy-symphony-interface` branch that modify files in the `src/services/emotion-tuning`, `commands/copilot`, `bin`, `test`, and `src/services/speech` directories.
- The workflow builds a distribution package, including the `aixtiv` CLI, and deploys it to Firebase Hosting.
- The workflow includes steps for checking out the code, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies, building the distribution, authenticating to Google Cloud, deploying to Firebase, running post-deployment tests, and notifying completion.

### Impact
- Introduces automated deployment of the emotion tuning system to Firebase Hosting.
- Depends on Google Cloud and Firebase credentials stored as GitHub secrets.
- The workflow includes a post-deployment test specifically for emotion tuning functionality.
- The deployment process involves creating `.tar.gz` and `.zip` archives of the distribution.
