ci: Add workflow for emotion tuning system deployment

This commit introduces a new GitHub Actions workflow to automate the build, deployment, and testing of the emotion tuning system. The workflow is triggered on pushes to the `deploy-symphony-interface` branch when specific files related to emotion tuning, speech, and the CLI are modified.

### Changes
- Created a new workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy-emotion-tuner.yml` to define the deployment process.
- The workflow is triggered on pushes to the `deploy-symphony-interface` branch with path filters for relevant files.
- The workflow includes steps for checking out code, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies, building a distribution archive (tar.gz and zip), and deploying to Firebase Hosting using Google Cloud credentials.
- Post-deployment tests using `npm test` are executed.
- A completion notification is generated and added to the GitHub step summary.

### Impact
- Automates the deployment of the emotion tuning system to Firebase Hosting.
- The system is packaged as both a `.tar.gz` and `.zip` archive.
- Introduces a dependency on Google Cloud credentials (`GCP_SA_KEY`), Firebase service account (`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`), and Firebase project ID (`api-for-warp-drive`) stored as GitHub secrets.
- Defines testing requirements for the emotion-tuning service.
